# Each bullet translates into a couple of slides

# Gitbook Setup to author the materials:
* Install node.js
* Install packages: ```npm install```
* To run: ```./node_modules/.bin/gitbook build```
* To access from browser: ```http://domain-name:4000```

# Per Gap:

* we are looking for lab/content to reflect Azure or Oracle Cloud (not Amazon Web Services)
* Also, would it be possible for Vlad to specifically include or call out Test Driven Design (TDD) principles in this training, perhaps in the lab work? I can bring a call together with our internal SME on TDD for this if helpful. We are looking to incorporate TDD across many of our offerings, even if only in a lightweight way, to influence adoption.

# Per Cisco:

* more AWS/Azure oriented probably with some Meraki influences, Google Cloud
* Private Cloud Solutions
* Cloud Managed Solutions
* Hybrid & Public Cloud Solutions
* All which can include Application Management, Business Performance, Actionable Intelligence & all with a Secure Environment with Software as a Service (Saas) & Platform as a Service (PaaS).

 
## General
  * Make sure to hyperlink your points using ```<a href="..." target="_blank"></a>``` for instructors and students  
  * Diagrams better than words, but are more time consuming to produce, make sure not to violate copyrights  
  * Cloud UI and Api changes fast, try to avoid too detailed steps to get students familiar to deal with the change  
  * If we need to store any files for students to download during the labs - we will use S3 instead of gitbook hosting
  * Summary of each chapter is good place to let students do the talking: ask questions instead of self reiteration 

## Chapter-01:

### Public cloud state of adoption
  * List benefits listed by public cloud providers compared to on-premises deployment using numbers and charts where available
  * Reference case studies by Aws and by Azure to demonstrate the marketing approach and independent research to reflect on industry reality
  * Use reputable web resources (maybe Gartner) to demonstrate growth in usage and in adoption plans for public cloud
  * Reference revenues generated by Microsoft and Amazon year-by-year 
  * Reference Azure/Oracle corporation strategic investment

### Motivation for public cloud
  * Reference different use-cases for cloud adoption success stories, from startups to old fashioned organizations
  * Reference a couple of horror stories migrating to public cloud and provide a brief explanation on mistakes made

### Why I cannot do it all in my own data centre?
  * Acknowledge that yes, you can do it all on your own hardware, especially when VM automation is the only purpose
  * List the number of services offered by Aws, Azure, Google, and Oracle public clouds in addition to VM management
  * Highlight that VM is not enough: network, load-balancers, firewalls, high availability and etc are essential as well
  * Pay a special attention to the ability to create an entire data centre with an automation such as terraform

### Lab: Cloud vs. on-premises
  * The lab is to question the wisdom whether public cloud is pretty much the same as on premises deployment with infra managed by a third party
  * Enumerate go-live activities related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_development_life_cycle" target="_blank">SDLC</a> after the code development is complete. Likely items:
    * Hardware planning and provisioning: what if there is no more storage left on the SAN?
    * Preparation of a deployment package, what if the build server is down?
    * What is the process of build verification and re-deployment, if needs to be?
    * Firewall requests, is there a single or multiple firewall involved, what happens when firewall is mis-configured?
    * How do you roll-out A/B testing, if not using it today could you with the on-premises deployment model?
    * What's required to configure a DNS name and how mis-configurations are resolved?
  * List anticipated and actual time-frames for the activities listed
  * Envision an unanticipated spike in traffic, how do you recover with an on-premises deployment?
  
### Considerations for different migration strategies
  * List migration strategies as described by leading cloud providers Aws and Azure
  * Outline pros and cons of each approach
  * Highlight that there is a conflict between what's common vs. what's advantageous
  * Find a reference what's the industry stats about selecting a migration strategy

### Lab: IaaS, PaaS, CaaS, FaaS, and DaaS
  * Students are to login into web console UI with prepared ahead-of-time accounts
  * Explain what has been prepared ahead of the course:
    * An account has been setup with a (nearly) full access for each participant
    * Nothing else was setup, you will find the same account as if you were to create a new one yourselves
    * Cloud UI changes often, there is a chance that new accounts will have a different look-and-feel
  * There is a default network setup - don't use it, start from scratch to remove the magic
  * Students are to create a small ip address space subnet network for every participant for a full isolation
  * Double check a single region/availability zone will sport up-to 20 students class
  * Prepare one backup network for Instructor ahead of time ready-to-use in case creation of network is delayed unexpectedly on the public cloud
  * Focus on minimal setup: one small subnet, one access group, one VM, one public ip, one application deployed e.g. apache/nginx web server with hello world
  * Configure the components required to access the web site with 'hello world' on it
  * Should students ask what about two web servers load-balanced, don't answer, ask them to find an answer using online search
  * Compare term differences between couple of clouds e.g. Azure and Oracle
  * Pose a question, where is my db, application server, disk storage, and etc.
  * Elaborate VM can be configured with or without public access and with any desired software installed
  * Walk through a couple (just a couple) of ready-to-use alternatives to VM: cloud function and database as a service
  * Get into the open question why VM (backward compatibility) or why not a VM (moving into a brave new world)

### Planning and executing a migration strategy
  * Find a horror story to create an emotional connection on how bad a poor execution can go
  * Borrow ideas from cloud migration webinars/articles
  * Emphasize with reference that there is no one size-fits-all strategy
  
### Lab: Current vs. Future state and possible approaches
  * Take a selected application offered by the students
  * Build a deployment layout:
    * How many application tiers?
    * How many servers to allocate for each tier?
    * Can the tier support auto-scaling, any in-memory state or a sticky session?
    * Are there any opportunities to leverage PaaS, FaaS, or DaaS in the future
  
### Getting ready for the adoption and migration setbacks
  * Big-bang approach is quite unforgiving for mistakes, iterative and agile maybe a more pragmatic direction
  * Things will blow as with every new major initiative - don't get discouraged
  * Reference common failures, small oversights vs. a big disaster
  * Provide links to forums and discussions
  * Find a failure story with a recovery plan to ignite confidence
  
## Chapter-03: Application Architecture

### Resource usage analysis
  * Importance of resource utilization analysis: expected vs. actual
  * General practice of resource utilization: io, cpu, memory, network, others
  * Linux tools for resource utilization analysis - don't pick a silver bullet, suggest built-in first, and additional second
  * Windows tools for resource utilization analysis - don't pick a silver bullet, suggest built-in first, and additional second
  * _TDD (test-driven-development) can we apply it to application testing for the purpose of migration as per customer desire?_ 
  * Lab: common tools for resource utilization:
    * Find a sample easy-to-install Linux server application, web-server & a database to reflect on a common pattern of business system
    * The application should have a web end-point that can be used for stress testing
    * Explain the application at the hight level by referencing vendor documentation instead of repeating the documentation in slides
    * Use a JMeter (if you have another tool - please suggest) to create a stress test
    * Walk through creating the stress test
    * Run the stress test to generate load
    * Use the tools explained earlier in the chapter to monitor the application under the stress and to record the finding
    * Maybe a Google Sheet shared with everyone in the class to see each other findings for the interactivity purposes
    * Important is to find out what is the real application resource pressures to assist decision on instance type to select
    * Discuss the discoveries made, whether it was consistent with a guessed resource utilization
    * Send the students to links with different instances types on different cloud providers to explore options and costs
  * Outline different disk storage available from Azure and from Oracle cloud
  * Guaranteed performance IO and correlation between volume and speed, if any on Azure and on Oracle Clouds
  * Lab: Instance types and and IO considerations
    * Find an easy to install application that generates and measures disk operations under stress
    * Install the app on Linux and on Windows
    * Run the app the record a base line
    * Change the volume type and/or volume size to demonstrate impact on the disk io performance
    * Prepare a script that will make the system to run out of space to bring it to a practical halt
    * Provide instructions for Azure Cloud how to recover from such a situation on Windows and on Linux
  * A bad common practice is to assume that network is always available
  * Elaborate on the common application failure patterns: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_failure">Cascading Failure</a> with emphasis on network connectivity
  * Lab: What to do when I cannot connect?
    * With the web-db application installed before
    * Run the stress test using JMeter to record a baseline
    * Emulate db connectivity failure, such as stopping the service or changing listener port
    * Run the stress test to demonstrate the response time/error rate when there is a connectivity problem
    * Reset and then record the JMeter stats to compare to the baseline
    * Bring the db back while running the stress test
    * Reset and then record the JMeter stats to compare to the baseline and to the failure state
    * How long it takes for the application to come back to the normal state
    * Repeat the test for taking the db down for a short period of time (maybe couple of iteration to find the sweet spot) to demo that recover can be a considerably longer than the actual downtime due to a typical application design pattern with a perfect network connectivity at all times
  * A common approach for caching and session management: in-proc, increasing memory demands on each instance, duplicating the cache, and requiring a sticky sessions. With such a approach auto-scaling out and back-in is a daunting task. Common resolution is to create an adapter to leverage caching service available on the public cloud and to externalize the session management.
  * Common pattern of building an application is to expect that every dependent component is available at all times and is performing within the well at all times. There is an alternative to a perfect world planning: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/category/resiliency. Review the patterns briefly - too much information will get the students lost
  * Lab: Common design patterns
    * Maybe use a google sheet to list the common design problems on the left and common solutions on the right
    * Every student/team can create a copy of the sheet or a copy of a tab in the same sheet
    * Ask students to present their answers on line-by-line basis to force a discussion and possible disagreements
    * The idea to drag the student out of the silos to keep them awake and engaged
