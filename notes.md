# TODO:

* iops lab does not demo a sufficient proof of better performance with a higher iops!
* cisco are mostly network and video streaming engineers, app architecture not relevant
* past two projects sees to indicate that lift-and-shift is not as practical

# Author Setup
* Install node.js and npm
* Clone the repository: ```git clone https://github.com/vkhazin/cloudmigration-courseware.git```
* Install npm dependencies: ```npm install```
* Install gitbook: ```sudo npm install -g gitbook-cli```
* To lunch for preview purposes: ```gitbook serve```
* The repository is auto-deployed to gitbook as a primary and to surge.sh as a secondary target for publishing

# Per Gap:

* we are looking for lab/content to reflect Azure or Oracle Cloud (not Amazon Web Services)
* Also, would it be possible for Vlad to specifically include or call out Test Driven Design (TDD) principles in this training, perhaps in the lab work? I can bring a call together with our internal SME on TDD for this if helpful. We are looking to incorporate TDD across many of our offerings, even if only in a lightweight way, to influence adoption.

# Per Cisco:

* Planning for migration chapter: sprinkle aws and google
* more AWS/Azure oriented probably with some Meraki influences, Google Cloud
* Private Cloud Solutions
* Cloud Managed Solutions
* Hybrid & Public Cloud Solutions
* All which can include Application Management, Business Performance, Actionable Intelligence & all with a Secure Environment with Software as a Service (Saas) & Platform as a Service (PaaS).
