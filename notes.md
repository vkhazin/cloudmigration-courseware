# Each bullet translates into a couple of slides


# Gitbook Setup to author the materials:
* Install node.js
* Install packages: ```npm install```
* To run: ```./node_modules/.bin/gitbook build```
* To access from browser: ```http://domain-name:4000```

# Per Gap:

* we are looking for lab/content to reflect Azure or Oracle Cloud (not Amazon Web Services)
* Also, would it be possible for Vlad to specifically include or call out Test Driven Design (TDD) principles in this training, perhaps in the lab work? I can bring a call together with our internal SME on TDD for this if helpful. We are looking to incorporate TDD across many of our offerings, even if only in a lightweight way, to influence adoption.

## General
  * Make sure to hyperlink your points using ```<a href="..." target="_blank"></a>``` for instructors and students  
  * Diagrams better than words, but are more time consuming to produce, make sure not to violate copyrights  
  * Cloud UI and Api changes fast, try to avoid too detailed steps to get students familiar to deal with the change  
  * If we need to store any files for students to download during the labs - we will use S3 instead of gitbook hosting
  * Summary of each chapter is good place to let students do the talking: ask questions instead of self reiteration 

## Chapter-01:

### Public cloud state of adoption
  * List benefits listed by public cloud providers compared to on-premises deployment using numbers and charts where available
  * Reference case studies by Aws and by Azure to demonstrate the marketing approach and independent research to reflect on industry reality
  * Use reputable web resources (maybe Gartner) to demonstrate growth in usage and in adoption plans for public cloud
  * Reference revenues generated by Microsoft and Amazon year-by-year 
  * Reference Azure/Oracle corporation strategic investment

### Motivation for public cloud
  * Reference different use-cases for cloud adoption success stories, from startups to old fashioned organizations
  * Reference a couple of horror stories migrating to public cloud and provide a brief explanation on mistakes made

### Why I cannot do it all in my own data centre?
  * Acknowledge that yes, you can do it all on your own hardware, especially when VM automation is the only purpose
  * List the number of services offered by Aws, Azure, Google, and Oracle public clouds in addition to VM management
  * Highlight that VM is not enough: network, load-balancers, firewalls, high availability and etc are essential as well
  * Pay a special attention to the ability to create an entire data centre with an automation such as terraform


### Considerations for different migration strategies
  * List migration strategies as described by leading cloud providers Aws and Azure
  * Outline pros and cons of each approach
  * Highlight that there is a conflict between what's common vs. what's advantageous
  * Find a reference what's the industry stats about selecting a migration strategy

### Lab: IaaS, PaaS, CaaS, FaaS, and DaaS
  * Students are to login into web console UI with prepared ahead-of-time accounts
  * Explain what has been prepared ahead of the course:
    * An account has been setup with a (nearly) full access for each participant
    * Nothing else was setup, you will find the same account as if you were to create a new one yourselves
    * Cloud UI changes often, there is a chance that new accounts will have a different look-and-feel
  * There is a default network setup - don't use it, start from scratch to remove the magic
  * Students are to create a small ip address space subnet network for every participant for a full isolation
  * Double check a single region/availability zone will sport up-to 20 students class
  * Prepare one backup network for Instructor ahead of time ready-to-use in case creation of network is delayed unexpectedly on the public cloud
  * Focus on minimal setup: one small subnet, one access group, one VM, one public ip, one application deployed e.g. apache/nginx web server with hello world
  * Configure the components required to access the web site with 'hello world' on it
  * Should students ask what about two web servers load-balanced, don't answer, ask them to find an answer using online search
  * Compare term differences between couple of clouds e.g. Azure and Oracle
  * Pose a question, where is my db, application server, disk storage, and etc.
  * Elaborate VM can be configured with or without public access and with any desired software installed
  * Walk through a couple (just a couple) of ready-to-use alternatives to VM: cloud function and database as a service
  * Get into the open question why VM (backward compatibility) or why not a VM (moving into a brave new world)

### Planning and executing a migration strategy
  * Find a horror story to create an emotional connection on how bad a poor execution can go
  * Borrow ideas from cloud migration webinars/articles
  * Emphasize with reference that there is no one size-fits-all strategy
  
### Getting ready for the adoption and migration setbacks
  * Big-bang approach is unforgiving for mistakes, iterative and agile maybe more pragmatic
  * Things will blow as with every new major initiative
  * Reference common failures
  * Provide links to forums and 
  * Find a failure story with a recovery plan to ignite confidence
