## [Eight fallacies of distributed computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_distributed_computing) 

* The network is reliable.
* Latency is zero.
* Bandwidth is infinite.
* The network is secure.
* Topology doesn't change.
* There is one administrator.
* Transport cost is zero.
* The network is homogeneous.


* Notice almost all of them, except **There is one administrator**, are communication and/or network related problems
