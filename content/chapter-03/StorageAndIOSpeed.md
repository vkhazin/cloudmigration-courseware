# Storage space and IO speed

* Basic options common on Public Cloud providers
  * Block/Disk storage aimed to be attached to a Virtual Machine to serve as a hard drive
  * Object storage designed to store binary or text files accessible using an API
  * Share-file storage intended to share data between cloud or on-premises virtual machines
  
  
* There are options for different performance, latency and throughput characteristics


* One test for storage performance is [Gartner Cloud Harmony test suite](https://github.com/cloudharmony/block-storage) here are a couple of resources regarding that test result on different cloud providers:
  * [Oracle Cloud Block Volume Performance Analysis](https://community.oracle.com/community/oracle-cloud/cloud-infrastructure/blog/2017/05/16/block-volume-performance-analysis)
  * [Azure Premium Storage: Design for High Performance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/premium-storage-performance#benchmarking)
