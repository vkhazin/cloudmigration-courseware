# Lab: Categorizing Systems for Migration

## Objectives

* List 3-4 systems that come to your mind, real or empirical
* Objective of the categorization is to evaluate suitability for, and challenges with, the cloud migration
* There are different instance types available on [Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/sizes) and on [Oracle](https://cloud.oracle.com/infrastructure/compute/virtual-machine/features) Cloud
* Please fill-out the [assement matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FYOwGFZcV2O3K80uICVlSqJMlSIidgnhv3qlZ41Bl2A/edit?usp=sharing) for current and/or envisioned systems. Any past system/applications can be used for the assessment as well
* Did you find any system/application that cannot be migrated to the public cloud due to hardware requirements/restrictions?
* What's the fall back strategy in case system/application cannot be migrated to the cloud?
* Are you able to evaluate a cost of one month operation for each system?
* Instance pricing vs. traffic pricing vs. storage - how do you find this information?
* Do you have any licensed software that is incompatible with public cloud deployment?
* Do a search to find out whether Oracle Rdbms license allows a deployment to Azure or to Aws?
