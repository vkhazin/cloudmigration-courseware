# Lab: Categorizing Systems for Migration

## Objectives

* Gain a new perspective on system categorization for the purpose of cloud migration
* Learn how to quickly assess system on the suitability for cloud migration
* Identify common system characteristics to validate in preparation for migration

## Steps

* List 3-4 systems that come to your mind, real or empirical
* Objective of the categorization is to evaluate suitability for, and challenges with, the cloud migration
* There are different instance types available on [Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/sizes) and on [Google](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types) Cloud
* Please duplicate the sample tab in the matrix for yourself to fill-out the [assessment matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FYOwGFZcV2O3K80uICVlSqJMlSIidgnhv3qlZ41Bl2A/edit?usp=sharing) for current and/or envisioned systems. Any past system/applications can be used for the assessment as well
* To duplicate the sample tab, right-click at the button and select duplicate
* Did you find any system/application that cannot be migrated to the public cloud due to hardware requirements/restrictions?
* What's the fall back strategy in case system/application cannot be migrated to the cloud?
* Are you able to evaluate a cost of one month operation for each system?
* Instance pricing vs. traffic cost vs. storage bill - how do you find this information?
* Do you have any licensed software that is incompatible with public cloud deployment?
* Do a search to find out whether Oracle Rdbms license allows a deployment to Azure or to Aws?
