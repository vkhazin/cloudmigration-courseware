# Lab : Current vs. Future state and possible approaches

* Select a simple application to migrate

* Which migration strategy would you use?

* How many tiers the application has?

* How the tiers are connected?

* Assign performance metrics and estimate how many servers we need per tier

* How the internal and external network should be configured?

* Do we need to change the application to use other cloud provider services, e.g.: PaaS, FaaS or DaaS in the future

* Which of the tiers could be eliminated by the use of other cloud provider services?
