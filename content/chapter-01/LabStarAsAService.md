# Lab: IaaS, PaaS, CaaS, FaaS, and DaaS

* Do you have a account with your cloud provider?
  * If you do, login into the cloud provider console interface
  * If you do not have an account, create one right now. It should take from five to fifting minutes to do so


* On your console, look around, and see what they offer


* Which of their services are:
  * Compute, e.g.: Virtual Machines, Containers, Functions/Lambdas
  * Storage, e.g.: block storage, RDMS, NoSql
  * Network, e.g.: networks, load balancers, VPNs
  * Do you see any other categories?


* Try to clasify their service into:
  * IaaS : Infrastructure as a Service
  * PaaS : Platform as a Service
  * CaaS : Containers as a Service
  * FaaS : Functions as a Service
  * DaaS : Data as a Service
