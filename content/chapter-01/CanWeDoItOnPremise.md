# Why I cannot do it all in my own data centre?

* Of course, **we can**. There is no magic on the "cloud"
* The problems are:
  * How much we can do?
  * How fast can we innovate?
  * How fast can we evolve?  

  
* Short product list offered by Public Cloud providers:
  * [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/products/): Compute, Storage, Database, Migration, Networking & Content Delivery, Developer Tools, Management Tools, Media Services, Security, Identity & Compliance, Analytics, Machine Learning, Mobile Services, AR & VR, ...
  * [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/services/): Virtual Machines, App Service, SQL Database, Storage, Functions, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Active Directory, Backup, HBInsight, Batch, Container Registry, Container Instances, Cloud Services, Azure Monitor, ...
  * [Googlec Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/): Compute, Storage and Databases, Networking, Big Data, Data Transfer, API Platform & Ecosystems, Internet of Things, Machine Learning, Management Tools, Developer Tools, Identity & Security, ... 
  

* Bottom line:
  * **Virtual Machines** are not the only aspect of a the Public Cloud (Ex. networks, recovery, applications, etc.)
  * We can create a complete data center inside the Public Cloud, but there is more than or we may need much less
