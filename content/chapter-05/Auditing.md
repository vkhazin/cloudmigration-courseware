# Monitoring

## Auditing

* Configuration changes
* Administrative changes, e.g. adding new users
* User access to critical systems, e.g. read medical records
* A pitfall: similar with the log management - maybe useless without an ongoing monitoring
* 3rd party and built-in services are available:
  * Aws offers number of [services](https://aws.amazon.com/answers/configuration-management/aws-infrastructure-configuration-management/)
  * [Azure Logging and Auditing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/azure-log-audit)
