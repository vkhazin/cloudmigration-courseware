# Configuration Management

## Overview

* How do you deploy and change configuration in prod and other environments today?
* Are there any pain points with the current approach?
* How well the existing approach scales from 1 to 10 and to 10,000 deployments?
* I am not planning to support 10,000 deployments should I revise my current methods?
* Do you practice [blue-green deployment, a/b testing, or canary releases](http://blog.christianposta.com/deploy/blue-green-deployments-a-b-testing-and-canary-releases/)?
* I am not looking forward to any of the describe release methodologies, should I care changing current methods?
* You should take [configuration management](https://www.upguard.com/blog/5-configuration-management-boss) to heart
