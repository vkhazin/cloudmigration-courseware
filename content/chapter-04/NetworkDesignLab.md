# Lab: Network design patterns

## Objectives

* Get familiar with Cloud Provider network design workflow
* Identify forthcoming growth challenges with limited IPv4 address space

## Steps

* Login into Cloud Provider portal
* Create a new network, subnet, and etc.
* Discuss the options popping up to understand the implications of decisions made
* Hhow isolated dev vs. test. vs. live networks and assets should be?
* Consider multi-region deployment model - any impact on a IP address space design?
* How do you know what address spaces are already in use by your organization and it's interconnected partners?
* How do we evolve balancing a limited network addresses space in a high paced environment?
* There is a shared services and a transit network [design proposal](https://www.aviatrix.com/blog/architectural-evolution-networking-public-cloud/)
* There is an evolutionary approach, but it requires changes not just in the network but also in the application [design patterns](http://vkhazin.postach.io/post/infra-and-app-evolution)
